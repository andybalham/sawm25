Uk decay then John Mackay 
Dash off to catch Richard Jobson
In interview with john robb. On
The run, groovy times never stop

Order approved, these long runtimes are great
Means that I get to miss Theatre of Hate

If im lucky, motels still on,
Settle in for She Wants Revenge
After which, PIL (2025) -
Wondering if first line up's still alive?

Order approved, these long runtimes are great
Thank God I've missed Theatre of Hate
Secretly itching to see the Motels
Who would have guessed? Oh, Please don't tell.

Happy Mondays at 5.30
Nostalgia quenched but still thirsty
End on The the on the main stage
A mindblowing headliner for the age

Unfortunately, the age in
Question is Fifty and above
