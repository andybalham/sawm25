Lurking in the woods
Underneath the shrubs
Mustela percussion
From a polecats cousin

Dance to the rhythm of the bongos
Dance with the weasel of the night
Dance to the rhythm of the bongos
Dance with the weasel of delight

Beating out a rhythm
Least weasel on a mission
All the stoats and ferrets
Are grooving with polecats

Dance to the rhythm of the bongos
Dance with the weasel of the night
Dance to the rhythm of the bongos
Dance with the weasel of delight

Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance
