There's new legislation
Coming to this nation
A mandate for the thieves
To take what they please

Who’s going to stop them?
No politicians
They’re all betrothed
To those tech bros

[Chorus]
Let 'em steal
Let 'em take what they like
Let 'em steal
All for AI
Let 'em steal
Let 'em harvest mankind
Let 'em steal
From you and I
Take the past
Cut it up
Then sell it
Back to us

They say you can opt out
But that is just a cop out
They’ll take what they like
Say they didn’t see the sign

All those MPs
Have no idea
Never wrote one
Single pop song

[Chorus]

Seven million books they burned
Just to help their machine learn
Libraries reduced to ash
All in the name of cash

[Chorus]
